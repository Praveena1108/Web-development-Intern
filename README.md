Welcome to my Web development Projects Collection repository! This repository contains three web-based projects developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each project showcases different aspects of front-end development, including user interface design, form handling, and basic calculations.
This is eventually done in my intern at LGM(LetsGrowMore)

Projects
1. To-Do List
A simple and interactive to-do list application that allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as complete. This project demonstrates the use of JavaScript for dynamic content manipulation and DOM handling.

2. Calculator
A basic calculator application with a clean and intuitive user interface. It supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator project highlights the use of JavaScript for event handling and real-time calculations.

3. Student Enrollment Form
A comprehensive student enrollment form that collects essential information such as name, age, and course selection. This project illustrates the use of HTML for form creation, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for form validation.
